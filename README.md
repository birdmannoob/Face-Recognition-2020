# Face-Recognition-2020
Uses caffe deep learning model to detect faces. 
Uses dlib's face_recognition library to generate embeddings, then compares and recognizes using SVM classifier.

The script 'FaceRecog(opencv + dlib).py' can be used to detect faces, and recognize faces that were trained in the model used.
In order to run the code 'FaceRecog(opencv + dlib).py' without modifying, just put all the files in the same directory.

#Notes: This repository do not include the dataset(images) used for training. If you want to retrain the model, simply create a folder named 'dataset' in the same directory as where you saved the other files, and in the folder, create invidual folders for each person with their names as the folder name.
